A Family of Wines

Running this code locally is as simple as in the lab -- as long as anyone
has downloaded react and node, after downloading these files you should be
able to use them as the source files in a directory with all downloaded react
necessities (created with npm create-react-app), and run the app with npm start from the terminal within that
directory.


Interface design principles:
I labeled the dropdown select menus with their respective purposes
to make them more learnable, and the simplicity of the dropdown I hope
makes it memorable as well. I'd say it's fairly efficient as well. Perhaps
if I had more time I would have also installed a complete-revert button.

I've learned in this class that I'm not good at CSS, so I do note that:
-There could be better whitespace between elements
-There could be better color contrast, particularly in the app header

Data passed through components and user-interaction:
The user selection of Type, Country and Sorting directly interact
with the FilteredList component to change its state. Then it uses
those states to filter its searches on the given item-list
(a prop of the filtered list). This list is then passed onto the 
List component which renders the list, perhaps sorted if so chosen.


High-level goal:
This application is useful for its ability to filter searches without
reloading the webpage, which is so much more convenient.

Webpage purpose:
This webpage is a searchable and filterable list of wines I enjoy.
It filters and searches through this list live, without the need to
reload!
